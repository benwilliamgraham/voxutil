"""Vox class for VoxUtil.

The goal of this module is to provide an interface for creating and modifying
MagicaVoxel .vox files. This class is not meant to be used directly to read and
write .vox files, but rather to provide a way to create and modify .vox files in
a way that provides a more Pythonic interface than the raw .vox file format.
